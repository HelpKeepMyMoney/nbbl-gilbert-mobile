# NBBL Gilbert Mobile

Next.js landing page for **NBBL Gilbert** — the first physical home of No Backboard Basketball in Gilbert, Arizona.

Opening September 1, 2026.

## Overview

A mobile-first marketing site with on-page forms for:

- **Session purchase** — HubSpot + PayPal payment link
- **Showcase registration** — HubSpot + PayPal payment link ($360/club)
- **Creator access** — HubSpot inquiry only
- **Fundraiser inquiry** — HubSpot inquiry only

**Production domain:** [nobackboardbasketballgym.com](https://nobackboardbasketballgym.com)

Until the custom domain is connected, the preview is [nbbl-gilbert-mobile.vercel.app](https://nbbl-gilbert-mobile.vercel.app).

The site is designed as a sports magazine / performance brand / basketball media property, not a generic gym, SaaS, or corporate template.

## Recent Changes

### HubSpot connection and segments

The site is connected to NBBL’s HubSpot portal (`247117755`). Each website form posts to its own HubSpot form GUID so contacts land in named segments:

| Website form | HubSpot segment |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Book Sessions | Paid Training Sessions |
| Showcase | Showcase Inquiries |
| Creator access | Content Creator Inquiries |
| Fundraiser | Fundraiser Inquiries |

Every submission writes `nbbl_segment` with that label. Active lists should filter on **form submission** so one contact can sit on more than one list. Portal ID and form GUIDs live in `.env.local` (`HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID`, `HUBSPOT_FORM_*`). Copy the same values into Vercel for production. Do not commit `.env.local`.

Paid session and showcase notes map to HubSpot’s standard `message` property. Fundraiser extras (expected clubs, dates, referral, notes) are concatenated into `message`. Custom properties that are not on the HubSpot forms are not sent, so HubSpot does not reject the submission.

Paid forms still record the lead in HubSpot **before** the visitor is sent to the PayPal payment link.

### PayPal payment links

All seven catalog products have PayPal Payment Links in `.env.local` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_*`). **Continue to payment** opens the matching hosted PayPal checkout, then returns to `/thanks`. Set the same variables in Vercel. REST create/capture routes remain as an unused fallback.

### Visual polish and conversion pass

The approved homepage architecture and business proposition were kept. This pass raised the visual language so the site feels like an established sports property.

Preserved:

- Section order and NBBL story
- Approved pricing in `lib/catalog.ts`
- FormHub tabs, PayPal checkout, HubSpot APIs, and environment variable names
- URL hashes `#book`, `#showcase-register`, `#creator-access`, `#fundraiser-inquiry`
- Package preselection via `/?package=school-eval#book`
- Sticky CTA, header navigation, and mobile menu

Visual and UX updates:

- Hero is full viewport with cinematic grading, condensed headline entrance, and Ken Burns movement on the strongest UHoop action photo
- **The Futsal of Basketball** uses oversized type, negative space, and a UHoop image that bleeds into Swish
- **Swish / Speed / Skill** are editorial chapters, not cards
  - Swish includes a large `16″` typographic treatment
  - Speed uses live-ball language and horizontal image drift
  - Skill stacks Think / Communicate / Pass / Finish / Decide
- **Practice your system / Scrimmage our system** is a vertical `01 → 02 → 03` training sequence, not a three-column feature row
- Team development still leads with the **$1,700 Four Session Development Evaluation**; other school packages stay behind progressive disclosure
- **Measure the work** is framed as sports performance technology, not a SaaS dashboard
- Competition, audience, and fundraising chapters use full-bleed photography and larger statements
- Showcase economics now reads **Event → Audience → Value → Shared participation**, then the equal 20% split as one band
- Gym #000 is a photo tour: Exterior → Court → UHoop → Bleachers/Stage → Production area, with a mobile swipe gallery and desktop mosaic
- Final CTA (**Start with your team.**) is visually separated from the form. The form follows under **Ready to get started?**
- Buttons, form tabs, and panels use a sharper editorial treatment instead of pill / card UI
- Image focal points are set per section and breakpoint so athletes and the UHoop stay in frame
- Motion is limited to fade/slide reveals, image scale, and subtle drift, and honors `prefers-reduced-motion`

### About and founder

- Homepage **Why NBBL?** section introduces the founder, Mark Tee Armstrong, without a long biography
- Founder portrait uses a vertical frame so the photo is not cropped into a banner
- **About** in the header and footer opens the homepage `#why` section
- **Learn About NBBL →** opens [remixed.nobackboard.com](https://remixed.nobackboard.com/)
- A dedicated `/about` route is not used

### Contact email

Site-wide contact email is [info@nobackboard.com](mailto:info@nobackboard.com), including footer, form fallback, PayPal notices, and HubSpot error copy.

### Next.js migration (from static HTML)

The site was rebuilt from a single `index.html` static page into a Next.js App Router application:

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Forms:** Four tabbed forms in `FormHub` (sessions, showcase, creator, fundraiser)
- **Payments:** PayPal Payment Links after form validation; HubSpot records the lead before checkout
- **CRM:** HubSpot Forms API, one form GUID per segment (`nbbl_segment`)
- **Assets:** Moved from `assets/` to `public/assets/`
- **Removed:** `index.html` (replaced by `app/page.tsx`)

## CTA and form navigation

All primary CTAs route to the on-page form hub and open the correct tab:

| Hash | Opens |
|------|-------|
| `#book` | Book Sessions (default) |
| `#showcase-register` | Register Showcase |
| `#creator-access` | Creator Access |
| `#fundraiser-inquiry` | Fundraiser Inquiry |

Pricing rows can pre-select a package via query string, e.g. `/?package=school-eval#book`.

`FormHub` syncs the active tab from the URL hash, scrolls to the form (not the section heading), and retries after hydration so Next.js does not leave the page at the top. `scroll-padding-top` accounts for the fixed header. `scroll-padding-bottom` keeps mobile content clear of the sticky CTA.

## Header navigation

The main menu links to on-page sections:

| Link | Target |
|------|--------|
| Train Your Team | `/#book` |
| Showcases | `/#showcases` |
| The NBBL Difference | `/#difference` |
| Fundraising | `/#fundraiser` |
| The Gym | `/#gym` |
| Creators | `/#creators` |
| About | `/#why` |

The header primary action is **Book Your Team →** and routes to `/#book`. The sticky mobile bar is **Train Your Team →** and also routes to `/#book`. The sticky bar hides on the hero and over the form hub.

## Approved pricing

Do not change these values in copy or in `lib/catalog.ts` without an explicit business decision.

| Product | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Four Session Development Evaluation | $1,700 |
| 12 Week Weekly Residency | $4,800 |
| 12 Week Twice Weekly Residency | $9,600 |
| Two Hour Team Session | $560 |
| Two Session Development Cycle | $1,000 |
| Four Session Development Cycle | $1,900 |
| Club Team Showcase entry | $360 per club |
| PPV | $9.99 |

Showcase economics: **20% NBBL / 20% Club 1 / 20% Club 2 / 20% Club 3 / 20% Club 4**.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + React
- PayPal Payment Links (REST create/capture remains as unused fallback)
- HubSpot Forms API (server-side submission, one form per segment)
- Google Fonts (Barlow Condensed, Inter)
- Static assets in `public/assets/`

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy environment placeholders:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Run production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

## Environment Variables

Add these to `.env.local`:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_SCHOOL_EVAL` | Payment link for Four Session Development Evaluation |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_SCHOOL_WEEKLY` | Payment link for 12 Week Weekly Residency |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_SCHOOL_TWICE_WEEKLY` | Payment link for 12 Week Twice Weekly Residency |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_CLUB_2HR` | Payment link for Two Hour Team Session |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_CLUB_2_SESSION` | Payment link for Two Session Development Cycle |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_CLUB_4_SESSION` | Payment link for Four Session Development Cycle |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_SHOWCASE` | Payment link for Club Team Showcase entry |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` | PayPal REST app client ID (unused by payment-link checkout) |
| `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` | PayPal REST app secret (unused by payment-link checkout) |
| `PAYPAL_ENV` | `sandbox` or `live` (unused by payment-link checkout) |
| `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` | HubSpot portal ID (server) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` | HubSpot portal ID (tracking script) |
| `HUBSPOT_FORM_SESSIONS` | Form GUID for session purchases |
| `HUBSPOT_FORM_SHOWCASE` | Form GUID for showcase registration |
| `HUBSPOT_FORM_CREATOR` | Form GUID for creator access |
| `HUBSPOT_FORM_FUNDRAISER` | Form GUID for fundraiser inquiries |

Local `.env.local` already has the PayPal payment links and HubSpot portal/form IDs. Production still needs the same values in Vercel (or the host). Until a value is set, paid forms tell the visitor to email [info@nobackboard.com](mailto:info@nobackboard.com), and inquiry forms return a configuration error.

## HubSpot Setup

The site does not embed HubSpot forms. Each website form posts to a matching HubSpot form GUID so contacts land in **separate segments**:

| Website form | HubSpot form name | Segment (`nbbl_segment`) | Env var |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Book Sessions | NBBL Session Purchase | Paid Training Sessions | `HUBSPOT_FORM_SESSIONS` |
| Showcase | NBBL Showcase Registration | Showcase Inquiries | `HUBSPOT_FORM_SHOWCASE` |
| Creator access | NBBL Creator Access | Content Creator Inquiries | `HUBSPOT_FORM_CREATOR` |
| Fundraiser | NBBL Fundraiser Inquiry | Fundraiser Inquiries | `HUBSPOT_FORM_FUNDRAISER` |

A contact can belong to more than one list (for example a coach who books sessions and later registers a showcase). `nbbl_segment` stores the **most recent** inquiry type on the contact record.

### 1. Portal ID

In HubSpot: **Settings → Account Management → Account Defaults**. The Hub ID is the portal ID.

Set both:

- `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` (server submissions)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` (tracking script in `app/layout.tsx`)

### 2. Contact properties

**Settings → Data Management → Properties → Contact properties → Create property.**

Use these **internal names** exactly. Create any that do not already exist.

| Internal name | Label | Type | Used by |
|---------------|-------|------|---------|
| `nbbl_segment` | NBBL Segment | Single-line text | All forms |
| `program_name` | Program / club name | Single-line text | Sessions, showcase |
| `organization_type` | Organization type | Single-line text | Sessions, showcase |
| `package` | Package | Single-line text | Sessions, showcase |
| `athlete_count` | Athlete count | Single-line text | Sessions, showcase |
| `preferred_start` | Preferred start | Single-line text | Sessions |
| `preferred_dates` | Preferred dates | Single-line text | Showcase, creator |
| `content_type` | Content type | Single-line text | Creator |
| `project_description` | Project description | Multi-line text | Creator |

Standard HubSpot fields already exist and are used by the API: `firstname`, `email`, `phone`, `company`, `message`.

Paid session/showcase notes and fundraiser extras are written to `message`, not custom `notes` / `expected_clubs` / `referral_source` fields. That matches the properties available on the live HubSpot forms.

Every field the API sends **must also exist on that HubSpot form**, or HubSpot rejects the submission.

### 3. Create four forms

**Marketing → Forms → Create form.** A regular (non-embedded) form is fine — the site submits through the Forms API.

Add the fields below to each form, including **NBBL Segment** as a hidden field.

**NBBL Session Purchase** and **NBBL Showcase Registration:** `firstname`, `email`, `phone`, `program_name`, `organization_type`, `package`, `athlete_count`, `preferred_start` (sessions), `preferred_dates` (showcase), `message`, `nbbl_segment`.

**NBBL Creator Access:** `firstname`, `email`, `phone`, `company`, `content_type`, `project_description`, `preferred_dates`, `nbbl_segment`.

**NBBL Fundraiser Inquiry:** `firstname`, `email`, `phone`, `company`, `message`, `nbbl_segment`.

The four form GUIDs for portal `247117755` are already in local `.env.local`. Copy them into Vercel for production. To rotate a form, copy the new GUID from the form editor URL or **Share → Embed** (`formId`) into the matching `HUBSPOT_FORM_*` env var.

### 4. Create segments (active lists)

**CRM → Lists → Create list → Active list** (or **Marketing → Segments**, depending on the HubSpot workspace).

Use **Form submission** as the filter so a person can sit on more than one list:

| List / segment name | Filter |
|---------------------|--------|
| Paid Training Sessions | Contact submitted form **NBBL Session Purchase** |
| Showcase Inquiries | Contact submitted form **NBBL Showcase Registration** |
| Content Creator Inquiries | Contact submitted form **NBBL Creator Access** |
| Fundraiser Inquiries | Contact submitted form **NBBL Fundraiser Inquiry** |

Optional extra filter: `nbbl_segment` is equal to the same label. Prefer form submission as the source of truth.

### 5. Local and production env

Local `.env.local` already has `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID`, and the four `HUBSPOT_FORM_*` GUIDs. Add the same values in Vercel (or the host) and redeploy, or production will not write contacts.

If a form GUID is missing, paid forms still go to PayPal and show a HubSpot warning; inquiry forms return a configuration error. Email fallback: [info@nobackboard.com](mailto:info@nobackboard.com).

## PayPal Setup

Paid forms use **PayPal Payment Links** created in a PayPal Business account.

1. Log in at [paypal.com](https://www.paypal.com) with the NBBL Business account.
2. Open **Pay & Get Paid → Payment Links and Buttons** (or [Create Payment Links and Buttons](https://www.paypal.com/buttons/)).
3. Create one reusable **Buy Now** link for each catalog product below. Use a **fixed price**, USD, no shipping, no tax.
4. In the **Confirmation** tab, turn on **Auto-return** and set the return URL to `https://nobackboardbasketballgym.com/thanks` (or the live Vercel URL plus `/thanks` until the custom domain is live).
5. Copy each shareable link (usually `https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/...`) into the matching `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_*` environment variable.
6. Set the same variables in Vercel (or your host), then redeploy.

| Product | Price | Environment variable |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Four Session Development Evaluation | $1,700 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_SCHOOL_EVAL` |
| 12 Week Weekly Residency | $4,800 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_SCHOOL_WEEKLY` |
| 12 Week Twice Weekly Residency | $9,600 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_SCHOOL_TWICE_WEEKLY` |
| Two Hour Team Session | $560 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_CLUB_2HR` |
| Two Session Development Cycle | $1,000 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_CLUB_2_SESSION` |
| Four Session Development Cycle | $1,900 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_CLUB_4_SESSION` |
| Club Team Showcase entry | $360 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_LINK_SHOWCASE` |

All seven links are already in local `.env.local`. Copy them into Vercel for production. Until a package's link is configured, **Continue to payment** tells the visitor to email [info@nobackboard.com](mailto:info@nobackboard.com).

REST order create/capture routes remain in the repo as a fallback. They are not used by the booking forms. The capture route still sends extra HubSpot fields (`notes`, `payment_status`, `paypal_order_id`, `amount_paid`) that the payment-link checkout does not use.
